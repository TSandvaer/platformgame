  To run the game, simply open index.html in a web browser. You can now:

  2. Use Production Mode to test the actual platforming gameplay
  3. View and manage game data in the dashboard
  4. Build upon the existing platform layout as you develop your scenes

  The game is ready for you to start adding more features and customizing the scenes as you build it out!
